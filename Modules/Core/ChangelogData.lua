-- The release notes shown by the What's New window, mirroring CHANGELOG.md.
--
-- Kept as data rather than parsed from the file at runtime, because an addon
-- cannot read its own files. When CHANGELOG.md gains an entry, add it here too;
-- the top entry is the one a player sees after updating.
--
-- The top entry's `version` is what decides whether the window opens by itself:
-- adding notes is what makes them appear. Keep it matching the TOC's Version
-- anyway - they describe the same release - and a mismatch is written to the
-- debug log at login, readable with /df log version before packaging.
--
-- Keep the bullets to a line each. These are read in a window in the middle of
-- a game, not a post-mortem: what changed, not why it broke.
--
-- Versions are plain x.y.z and nothing else. The earlier "0.41.0-revived1" and
-- "Revived 2" tried to make the version carry the fact that the project has new
-- maintainers, which it announced once and then repeated forever, and left the
-- number unable to say the only thing a version is for: which build is newer.
-- The `title` is where a release gets a name, and it should describe the
-- release rather than number it - "Revived" was the launch, "Revived 2" was
-- just the one after it.

The party health and power bars carried lockColor, Blizzard\'s own opt-out for re-tinting a bar - and setting it writes a field onto a protected frame that Blizzard reads back on every health and power event. That read handed our taint to Blizzard, and the member.unit written next carried the blame. It hit all four pooled member frames, in use or not, which is why it only ever showed on the portrait-style party frames and never on the raid-style ones. Colour and power art are re-asserted with a hook now, and nothing of this addon is left on the frame.',
