# Changelog

DragonflightUI Revived — the community-maintained continuation of
DragonflightUI Classic, picking up after upstream's last release (v0.40.3,
May 2026). Current builds report version `0.46.0`.

Everything before v0.40.3 is in
[upstream's releases](https://github.com/Karl-HeinzSchneider/WoW-DragonflightUI/releases).

## 0.46.0 — Chat Edit Mode, Castbar Ticks & Localization (12 September 2026)
Fixed custom chat tab overlapping and selection issues in Edit Mode, restored channel ticks on MoP and TBC with target and focus support, added full localization coverage across German, Spanish, Russian and Simplified Chinese, and added an option to customize elite dragon coloring in Dark Mode.
**Highlights** — User-created chat tabs no longer overlap with General in Edit Mode and are properly preserved when exiting · channel ticks (Arcane Missiles, Penance, Drain Soul, Evocation, Mind Flay, etc.) now reliably display on MoP and TBC Classic · Target and Focus castbars now support channel ticks · full localization coverage added for German (`deDE`), Spanish (`esES`), Russian (`ruRU`), and Simplified Chinese (`zhCN`) · Dark Mode option added to customize whether elite/rare portrait dragon textures are darkened or keep normal coloring
### Chat
- Fixed custom/user-created chat tabs overlapping with the General channel when entering or exiting HUD Edit Mode (GitHub issue #40).
- Fixed the chat frame selection box in Edit Mode being unclickable or missing when viewing a custom chat channel tab.
- Preserved the player's active chat tab when exiting Edit Mode instead of forcibly jumping back to the General channel.
- Enforced single-frame visibility for docked chat frames in `FixDockedFrames` and `ApplySettingsInternal` so inactive docked frames are never shown concurrently.
### Castbars
- Restored channel ticks on MoP and TBC Classic clients by ensuring tick data, spacing and channel duration scale properly across non-Vanilla clients.
- Extended channel tick support to Target and Focus castbars (`DragonflightUITargetCastbar`, `DragonflightUIFocusCastbar`) and Boss frames.
- Added `/df log castbar` diagnostics command to dump client flavor, channel tick tables, player/target/focus castbar states, and active channeling spell info.
### Localization
- Added comprehensive AI-generated translations covering all missing strings across German (`deDE`), Spanish (`esES`), Russian (`ruRU`), and Simplified Chinese (`zhCN`).
- Replaced hardcoded strings across UI mixins, config categories, and Edit Mode with proper `AceLocale-3.0` lookups.
### Dark Mode
- Added an option under Dark Mode settings (`/df` -> General -> Dark Mode) to toggle whether the rare/elite portrait dragon ornament is darkened or retains its original coloring.
### Debugging
- Added `/df log castbar` diagnostics tool for troubleshooting castbar ticks and channeling state across game versions.
- Added `GENERAL_CHAT_DOCK` to the `chat` watch group in `/df log watch`.

## 0.45.2 — Totem Frame, Vehicle UI & Professions (8 September 2026)
Added a clean activation toggle for the Player Totem Frame, fixed the Profession Frame and Runeforging in MoP Classic, and resolved vehicle button positioning issues.
**Highlights** — Player Totem Frame can now be toggled on/off under `/df` -> Unitframes -> Player Totem Frame and in HUD Edit Mode · re-enabling the frame immediately restores and updates active totems without requiring a `/reload` · TotemFrame reliably retains its position after totems expire or Totemic Call is used · fixed Runeforging and modern professions failing to open in MoP Classic
### Professions
- Fixed the Profession Frame failing to open for Runeforging and modern professions in MoP Classic.
- Switched `UpdateProfessionData` to use `DF.InterfaceVersion >= DF.Expansions.Cata` so MoP Classic (and future Classic expansions) correctly uses Blizzard's modern `GetProfessions()` API instead of falling back to legacy Vanilla/TBC/Wrath `GetNumSkillLines()`.
- Registered Runeforging (spell ID `53428`) for all expansions from WotLK onwards using `DF.InterfaceVersion >= DF.Expansions.WotLK`.
- Added a fallback in `UpdateProfessionData` to ensure `skillTable['runeforging']` is initialized for Death Knights even before the spellbook is scanned.
- Suppressed the rank progress bar and tab tooltip skill readout (`Skill: 1/1`) for unranked professions (Runeforging, Beast Training) via `noRank = true` in `professionDataTable`.
- Added `Version.Expansions` and `DF.Expansions` version constants in `API/Version.API.lua` for safe, future-proof expansion comparisons.
### Unit Frames
- Added an **Active** toggle (`activate`) to the Player Totem Frame submodule, providing a clean way to hide or disable the totem frame (e.g. for players using dedicated totem addons like TotemTimers) without relying on heavy secure state handlers.
- When toggling the frame back on, Blizzard's `TotemFrame` is shown and refreshed straight away so existing active totems appear without a reload. It goes through `TotemFrameMixin:Update`; the older `TotemFrame_Update()` global is tried first but does not exist on any supported client, so that branch never runs.
- Fixed a minor naming error in Edit Mode options where the Totem Frame reset preset was labelled as 'Pet'.
- Fixed Blizzard's `TotemFrame` losing its anchor points (`points = 0`) and disappearing from the screen when totems expire or "Ruf der Totems" (Totemic Call) is cast. It is kept out of Blizzard's `UIParentManagedFrameContainer` by `ignoreFramePositionManager`, which makes `AddManagedFrame` bail before it can `ClearAllPoints` and reparent, and the anchor is restored from an `OnShow` script hook if it is ever lost anyway.
- Three further fields that were set on `TotemFrame` for the same purpose are gone, because each was redundant and each was the same shape as the `leftPadding` write below — a field of ours on a Blizzard frame that Blizzard reads back. `IsInDefaultPosition` was meant to stop `RemoveManagedFrame` wiping the anchors at `UIParent.lua:206`, but with `AddManagedFrame` bailing at `:163` the frame is never registered, so `RemoveManagedFrame` returns at `:201` and never gets there. `ignoreInLayout` is read where a container walks its own children, and this frame is reparented onto ours. The write into Blizzard's `showingFrames` table cleared a key that is never set. Two re-entrancy markers on `TotemFrame` and `FocusFrameToT` became closure locals for the same reason.
- The blank 38px gap in front of the totem icons is gone, and Blizzard's `leftPadding` is left alone to do it. The first attempt wrote `0` over that field, which Blizzard sets from XML — and Blizzard reads it back inside `LayoutMixin:Layout` (`LayoutFrame.lua:209`), which `TotemFrameMixin:Update` calls on every totem event. That made its own execution insecure, and the `PlayerFrame.unit` it wrote next carried the blame: `TargetOfTargetMixin:Update` reads that variable two lines before a protected `Show()` (`TargetFrame.lua:947` and `:949`), so target-of-target and target-of-focus had both `Show` and `Hide` refused for the rest of the session once combat started. The gap is offset on our side of the anchor now; the field stays Blizzard's, and reading it costs nothing.
- The player, target and target-of-target power bars no longer drive Blizzard's `UnitFrameManaBar_UpdateType` to pick up a power colour under a custom bar texture. That function writes `powerType`, `powerToken` and `currValue` onto a protected status bar and reads all three back on its own hot paths, so calling it from here left them insecure for the session — on the target frame it ran on every health poll tick. The colour is looked up from `PowerBarColor` instead, which is a read and taints nothing.
### Action Bars
- Fixed Blizzard's `MainMenuBarVehicleLeaveButton` detaching from DragonflightUI's container frame (`DragonflightUIVehicleLeaveButton`) and jumping to the bottom-left above the chat when boarding a flight path or entering a vehicle.
- Marked `MainMenuBarVehicleLeaveButton` with `ignoreFramePositionManager = true` so Blizzard's `UIParent_ManageFramePositions` leaves its anchors untouched.
- Ensured `MainMenuBarVehicleLeaveButton` is re-anchored to `DragonflightUIVehicleLeaveButton` in `Update()`, on `OnShow`, and protected with a defensive `SetPoint` hook against external repositioning.
### Debugging
- `/df log seed` also watches `PlayerFrame.unit` now, the variable that gates target-of-target, and reports the stack the moment it goes insecure along with the fields on the frames Blizzard touches on that path. Read the note above it before trusting the field list: the captured stack is pure Blizzard, so it names where the value was written and never which read did the tainting — three chains derived from Blizzard's source were wrong before a bisect and an on/off switch found the real one.
- Added `/df log vehicletrace` (with `off` and `copy` options) to log every `SetPoint`, `Show`, and `Hide` on `MainMenuBarVehicleLeaveButton` with caller stack traces.
- Added `DragonflightUIVehicleLeaveButton` to the `bars` group in `/df log watch`.

## 0.45.1 — Party Health Bars (6 September 2026)
Follow-up to 0.45.0: the party health bars keep their colour and their number without being hovered, and a preset Edit Mode layout no longer taints the party frames on every login.
**Highlights** — health bars stay class-coloured instead of snapping back to green · the health number no longer trails the target frame by a tick · no more taint on the party frames while you are on one of Blizzard's preset layouts
### Unit Frames
- Fixed the party health bars falling back to Blizzard's green, and the health number lagging behind. Both had the same cause: these bars carry `frequentUpdates`, so `UNIT_HEALTH` is never registered on them — Blizzard polls them through `UnitFrameHealthBar_OnUpdate`, which calls `SetValue`, which fires `OnValueChanged`, and *that* is where the green is set (`HealthBar_OnValueChanged`, Blizzard_GameTooltip/HealthBar.lua:30). The repaint that replaced `lockColor` in 0.45.0 was hooked to `UnitFrameHealthBar_Update` instead, which barely runs for these frames — measured in a group: 21 green writes from the poll against 4 repaints from the hook. Hooking `OnValueChanged` sorts out the colour and the readout in one place. `HealthBar_OnValueChanged` also turns out to be a second reader of `lockColor`, which is why this survived 0.45.0.
- The bar art is only re-assigned when it actually changes, instead of on every value change.
### Edit Mode
- Fixed the party frames being tainted at every login while a preset layout is active. The raid settings were mirrored onto the party system unconditionally, and that runs Blizzard's applier — which rebuilds `PartyFrame.settingMap` from addon code, the table Blizzard reads on every `ShouldShow`, so on every group event. It only ever showed on presets: a layout of your own already holds the values and the applier is skipped, while on a preset nothing can be stored, every value mismatches, and it ran every single time. `/df log party` reported 25 insecure spots before, none after. The mirror now runs only while raid-style party frames are actually up, which is the only case it was ever for.
### Debugging
- `/df log party` reports the bar repaint path — whether the hooks exist, fire, and reach the party bars — the raid-style setting across all five places it passes through, and the live state of a member's bars: colour against the wanted colour, art, fill level against real health, and the fields that gate Blizzard's health poll.

## 0.45.0 — Party Frames in Combat & a Quiet Startup (2 September 2026)
The party frames no longer break when someone levels up mid-fight, the chat spam and frame drop at the end of a fight are gone, and the leftover Edit Mode layout is cleaned up without anyone having to do it by hand.
**Highlights** — party frames survive a group member levelling up, or an invite, in combat · **Show party as raid** works at all now, takes effect on the next reload and asks for one when switched · a tick that disagrees with your layout is corrected instead of lying to you · no more `combat ended - finishing setup` after a group invite, and no frame drop with it · leftover `DragonflightUI_Layout` renamed and reused, or removed · party members get their class colour as soon as the game knows it · mouse clicks no longer blocked when disabling the Action Bar module
### Action Bars
- Fixed mouse clicks being completely blocked across the screen when the Action Bar module was deactivated in settings. The micro menu and bag bar holder frames no longer span the full screen and are properly hidden when deactivated.
### Unit Frames
- Fixed **Show party as raid** doing nothing at all. The value was written into the Edit Mode layout by reading it back off Blizzard's system frame first — which is only correct after Blizzard's own setter has converted and stored it, and on this path that setter is deliberately never run. So the old value was read and stored as if it were the new one, every time. The layout kept saying `0` no matter what the checkbox said, the reload had nothing to apply, and only the preview in DragonflightUI's own Edit Mode ever changed.
- The switch no longer runs Blizzard's appliers. Flipping it used to call `EditModeManagerFrame:UpdateSystem(PartyFrame, forceFullUpdate)` and six more Blizzard functions on a deferred tick, meaning to make the change visible at once. It did the opposite twice over: `UpdateSystem` runs *every* applier the system has, from our execution, which left `settingMap`, `systemInfo`, `savedSystemInfo` and `dirtySettings` on `PartyFrame` insecure, plus `optionTable` and `isLootObject` on all ten compact frames and `member.unit` on all four pooled ones — and it applied the *old* value, because it reads the layout rather than our profile. That is why the switch looked inert while still breaking the frames.
- The checkbox now describes what the frames are doing. If the two disagree — which everyone carries forward who ticked the box on an older build, where the setting was never stored — the tick is moved to match the layout and you are told once per character. The layout wins rather than the profile, because it is what the game actually applies and also where Blizzard's own Edit Mode writes this setting; the other way round would silently overrule a change made there.
- Fixed the third cause of the blocked actions: the health and mana readouts inside the party bars. On 1.15.9 no unit frame ships a `TextString`, so this addon supplied one — which is exactly what made the numbers appear, and a taint seed of the first order. `TextStatusBarMixin:UpdateTextString` opens with `local textString = self.TextString` and runs at the end of every health and power update, so the read handed our taint to Blizzard, and `currValue`, `disconnected`, `healthbar.unit` and finally `member.unit` were all written insecure by Blizzard's own code as a result. The strings are ours now, kept off the bars entirely, and filled from the same hook that already handles the bar colour. The Status Text option and its numeric, percentage and combined modes all still work, including reveal on mouseover.
- Fixed the second cause of those blocked actions, the one that outlived the applier fix below. The party health and power bars carried `lockColor`, Blizzard's own opt-out for re-tinting a bar — and setting it means writing a field onto a protected frame that Blizzard reads back on every health and power event. The read handed our taint to its execution, and the `member.unit` written next through `UnitFrame_SetUnit` carried the blame. All four pooled member frames were affected, in use or not, which is why this only ever showed on the portrait-style party frames and never on the raid-style ones. Colour and power art are re-asserted from a global `hooksecurefunc` now, which restores the taint state when it returns.
- Fixed the blocked actions on the party frames. Flipping the raid-style switch ran Blizzard's own applier for it, and that one reaches into both party displays at once — `member.unit` on the portrait frames via `UpdateRaidAndPartyFrames`, `optionTable` on the compact ones via `CompactPartyFrame:RefreshMembers()`. Run from addon code those fields stay insecure for the rest of the session, and the next invite or level-up in combat had its `SetAttribute`, `Hide` and `SetShown` refused. Ten seconds passed between cause and symptom in the traced log, which is why it looked so erratic.
- The setting is stored in the Edit Mode layout now and the game applies it while loading, out of its own execution. That means the switch needs a reload to take effect, and it asks for one when you change it. Every other setting still applies immediately.
- DragonflightUI never reloads the interface on its own any more. `reload()` is a protected call and the client refuses it in combat, which briefly made this addon produce the very error class it was meant to remove.
- The raid appliers only run inside an actual raid. Outside one there is no container to arrange, so they were pure cost and seeded that taint.
- Raid-style party frames keep their size again: raid settings are mirrored onto the party system, which is where `CompactUnitFrame` reads them from via `GetRaidFrameWidth(frame.groupType)`.
- Role icons are restyled after Blizzard's own update instead of during it.
- Party members are recoloured once their class information arrives instead of staying white.
- Edit Mode settings that already hold the wanted value are no longer re-applied.
### Edit Mode
- A preset layout cannot store the raid-style party frame setting, so DragonflightUI adds `DFUI_Revived_Layout` — a copy of the active layout — and switches to it. The game then applies the setting itself at login and this addon never touches it again. If you already work on a layout of your own, nothing is added.
- Leftover `DragonflightUI_Layout` (Issue #27) is repaired, renamed to `DFUI_Revived_Layout` and reused where a layout is needed, or deleted where it is not. The popup with delete instructions and `/df layoutnotice` are gone.
- New: `/df layoutretry`, for when adding that layout did not work the first time.
### Core & Architecture
- Deferring routine work is separated from recovering a reload that happened mid-fight. A group invite during combat used to queue as unfinished setup, announce itself twice in chat, and re-apply the settings of every module once combat dropped — actionbars, bags, unit frames, minimap, chat, tooltips. That was the lag spike at the end of a fight.
- A roster change outside a raid now does nothing at all, rather than being deferred and then doing nothing.
- Messages about a condition nobody can act on are said once per character instead of at every login.
- Two "already hooked" markers this addon wrote onto Blizzard's frames — `ChatFrame1.DFChatAnchorHooked` and `EditModeManagerFrame.DFChatHooked` — live in our own table now. They only ever answered a question about us, and any field of ours on a frame Blizzard reads is a taint seed waiting for the read.
- Failures while saving an Edit Mode layout are reported instead of swallowed. The `pcall` around it hid the bug above for an entire evening of testing.

## 0.44.3 — Action Bar Usability & Consumable Fixes (1 September 2026)

Targeted fixes for action bar empty consumable items displaying as usable on login.

**Highlights** — Action Bars: fixed empty consumables (count = 0) displaying as colored/usable on login · hooked button usability, update, and count functions for real-time state sync

### Action Bars
- Fixed empty consumables (count = 0) displaying as fully usable/colored on login until Edit Mode was toggled.
- Hooked `UpdateUsable`, `Update`, and `UpdateCount` on action buttons and registered bag update events (`BAG_UPDATE`, `BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED`) so depleted items gray out immediately.

## 0.44.2 — Stance Bar Fixes & In-Combat Protection (1 September 2026)

Targeted fixes for the Stance Bar (shapeshift bar) and in-combat reload stability.

**Highlights** — Stance Bar: fixed `ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED: StanceBar:SetShownBase()` taint error in combat · fixed flickering and disappearing stance buttons during action bar updates · corrected stance button reparenting and scaling · Raid Frames: protected in-combat `/reload` from `CompactPartyFrameMember1:SetSize()` blocked action errors

### Action Bars & Stance Bar
- Fixed `ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED: StanceBar:SetShownBase()` taint error on shapeshift / stance changes in combat by silencing background Blizzard `StanceBar` events and ensuring clean button ownership.
- Fixed stance buttons disappearing on macro hover and spell casts by overriding `UpdateGridState` to route to `UpdateButtonState` instead of querying action slot IDs.
- Corrected button reparenting mismatch so `StanceButton1..10` are properly parented to `DragonflightUIStancebar`, inheriting correct frame strata, alpha, and scaling.

### Unit Frames
- Deferred `RaidFlowWatcher` settings and container updates during combat (`Helper:RunOutOfCombat`) to avoid `CompactPartyFrameMember1:SetSize()` `ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED` errors on mid-fight `/reload`.

## 0.44.0/0.44.1 — The Definitive Refactor & Stability Overhaul (26 August - 31 August 2026)

Complete stability and architecture overhaul: permanent decoupling from Blizzard Edit Mode, combat reload visual preservation, robust TBC totem positioning, solid ChatFrame anchoring, and instant live Darkmode switching.

**Highlights** — login Lua errors fixed at the cause (#26, #28) · party frame taint seed found and removed · genuinely decoupled from Blizzard EditMode · bag row spacing and keyring position stable at last (#30) · seamless combat reload holder positioning · TBC/Era chat frame permanence · Shaman totem anchoring · live Darkmode toggle without /reload · actionbar dividers restricted to main bar

### Core & Architecture
- Fixed the login Lua errors in Issues #26 and #28, at the cause: a Blizzard setter was being called with no argument, which erased Blizzard's edit mode layout for the rest of the session.
- Genuinely decoupled from Blizzard's Edit Mode: it stays blocked, no Blizzard function is replaced any more, and settings live in this addon's own profile instead of Blizzard's layout.
- Leftover `DragonflightUI_Layout` (Issue #27): a one-time notice explains how to remove it, with an opt-out; `/df layoutnotice` brings it back. Stale anchors inside it are cleaned up automatically.
- `LibEditModeOverride` removed - loaded on every flavour, never called.
- Streamlined expansion detection across Era, TBC, Wrath, Cata and MoP.
- Silenced the on-screen combat reload banner and sped up post-combat recovery to 100ms.
- Escape closes our windows again without stealing keyboard focus. Stopped leaking generic names into `_G`.

### Chat
- TBC & Era: the chat window stays anchored through loading screens, reloads and resizing without disappearing.

### Unit Frames & Party / Raid
- Raid frames are configurable from DragonflightUI at last - raid size, frame width and height, group split, border, sort order, template, opacity, icon size - under Unitframes ▸ Raid Frame and in this addon's own edit mode, with a preview. No more disabling the addon to reach Blizzard's Edit Mode.
- Raid frames appear in an actual raid, and the raid settings now survive a reload.
- Raid frame settings also apply to raid-style party frames, which Blizzard keeps as a separate system.
- The raid frame placeholder now matches the frames, and the raid grows right and down from its corner instead of outwards from its middle.
- Fixed "Use Raid-Style Party Frames" (Issue #14) switching immediately and living through a `/reload`.
- Found and removed the party frame taint seed - two fields this addon wrote onto Blizzard's `PartyFrame` that Blizzard itself reads on every visibility check.
- Party member names and health/mana text unified to the FRIZQT outline font.
- Shaman totem bar anchors correctly instead of snapping below the player frame.
- Pet frame no longer jumps to default coordinates when summoning a pet.
- TBC: the pet frame is back after being saved to the layout but never placed.
- Focus target frame restored on TBC and MoP, and no longer errors on layout updates (Issues #19, #33); target faction icon fixed on Era.
- Fixed a combat reload error from target-of-target not being built yet.

### Action Bars
- Pet bar buttons resized to their correct scale and centred (Issue #13).
- Fixed `ADDON BLOCKED` errors on spellbook open, levelling up and pet casts.
- Pet action buttons are clickable immediately on login.
- Bar dividers now only appear on Action Bar 1, not 2-8.
- Removed legacy Blizzard gryphon art and duplicate visuals on TBC.
- Fixed Action Bar 1 scaling and in-combat alignment.
- Flyout direction *Up* works properly.
- MoP: the latency indicator sits correctly on the game menu button.
- Keyring suppressed on Cata and MoP, kept on Era, TBC and Wrath.
- Unchecking "Show as experience bar" hides the reputation text immediately.
- Fixed duplicate FPS/latency frames (Issue #16).
- MoP: fixed the bag counter's placement and text size.
- Bag row spacing (Issue #30): the bags no longer drift apart on their own - on login, on collapse and expand, and after a reload, in combat included.
- Keyring position (Issue #30): stays at the end of the row instead of landing in the middle of the bags.
- Keyring spacing (Issue #30): sits at the correct distance from the last bag instead of overlapping it.
- Keyring scale (Issue #30): scales with the rest of the bag row.
- New: `/df log bagtrace` for tracing bag row and keyring issues.

### Professions
- Skill rank text is visible again (Issue #29) - it was drawn behind the bar's own fill texture.
- Restored Beast Training and CraftFrame support for Hunter pets on Era, Season of Discovery and TBC.
- Fixed a MoP and Cataclysm startup crash in the profession window.

### Dark Mode
- Live toggle: switch Dark Mode on and off without a `/reload`.
- Party member borders go dark with every other unit frame, and stay dark through a roster change.

### Nameplates
- Fixed a repeating error from querying a nameplate's parent when it was not a frame. Reported with Plater.

## 0.43.0 — Party frames and professions (13 August 2026)

Party frames stay put in combat, the profession window behaves, and TBC starts
up again.

**Highlights** — party frames survive combat · one profession window, and you
can move it · TBC: fixed a crash on startup · Hide Clock finally sticks

### Party frames

- Members no longer vanish, or collapse to a single member, when combat starts.
  This addon was applying Blizzard's edit mode layout at login, which tainted
  the party frames for the rest of the session

### Profession window

- Tradeskills open one window instead of two. Blizzard's was left sitting behind
  ours unless you happened to have BlizzMove installed. Enchanting still shows
  Blizzard's craft window, because the **Enchant** button lives on it
- Drag it by its header, and it stays where you put it
- No more empty profession window at every login
- The profession icon fills its ring instead of sitting inside a border

### Edit mode

- New setting: **Disable Blizzard's Edit Mode**, on by default. Saving in
  Blizzard's writes its whole layout over this one, so the game's own ways in
  are switched off
- **Rotate Minimap** survives a reload. It was written somewhere the game
  overwrites every time it applies its layout

### Unit frames

- Stopped tainting the target frame's debuff buttons, a long-standing source of
  blocked actions
- **TBC:** fixed a flood of `Invalid frame handle` errors during combat

### Minimap

- **Hide Clock** stays hidden after a reload or relog

### Castbar

- **TBC:** fixed an error on startup when the target frame had not been placed
  yet

### Character pane

- Tab labels are vertically centred again, in both the selected and unselected
  tab
- The pane was building itself out of the game's script budget and getting cut
  off partway, which left it half-made

### Action bars

- The keyring stays on the end of the bag bar instead of wandering in among the
  bags when the bag menu is opened and closed

### Tooltips

- Fixed the tooltip body flickering on and off while you hover it. Blizzard put
  its own backdrop back on every refresh and ours took it away again

### Under the hood

- Removed leftover debug messages that printed to chat
- The addon no longer writes a performance log to your SavedVariables every
  session

## 0.42.0 — Fixes from the field (30 July 2026)

### Loot rolls

- Hovering **Need**, **Greed** or **Pass** names who chose it again
- The count is back on each button; an empty Pass reads `0`
- The line under the item name no longer repeats those numbers — it shows how
  many have yet to answer, then the winner
- The settings preview shows a live roll, tooltips included

### Request Stop / vehicle exit button

- Sits above the top action bar, flush with the left edge, at button size, with
  the same frame as every other button
- Glows while it can actually be clicked — it had no usable-or-not look at all
- Can be turned off, and previewed from the settings without catching a flight

### Action bars

- Scrolling bar 1 no longer cycles through bars already on screen. This only
  ever worked on TBC
- The page number no longer sits offset on the first render
- **Pet Bar** works as an anchor — it pointed at a frame that does not exist

### Unit frames

- Fixed a burst of Lua errors at login, from the player, target, pet and
  secondary resource frames
- Health and mana numbers show on party frames with **Status Text** on

### Edit mode

- **Use Raid-Style Party Frames** works, and stays put. The toggle wrote a
  setting the game no longer reads, and Blizzard's own checkbox was being undone
  on the next reload or dungeon

### Compatibility

- Fixed an error at login with **Clique**, which was also costing Clique its
  party frame mouse handling

### Buffs

- The settings page now says plainly that the game's **Consolidate Buffs**
  option cannot reach DragonflightUI's buff frame

### Elsewhere

- The Discord button opens this project's server, not the original author's
- BuyMeACoffee removed — it collected for upstream

### For bug reports

- The version number is real; reports no longer read `@project-version@`
- New `/df log watch` — run it, reproduce the problem, run it again. It reports
  what moved and opens a window to copy
- One less source of taint errors carrying DragonflightUI's name

## 0.41.2 — Bug reports, answered (27 July 2026)

### Blue shamans (new)

- New setting under Misc → Utility → **Class Colors**. Era gives shamans the
  paladin's pink; this makes them TBC's blue
- Off by default. Nameplates and default chat stay pink — the game colours
  those, not us

### Target frame combat glow

- The glow traces the frame now instead of sitting beside it, and turns the ring
  red rather than hiding behind it
- Target, focus, boss frames and the edit mode preview each get their own

### Action bars

- Fixed placing and moving spells with **Always show action bar** off (TBC)
- Fixed stack counts left behind on a slot you dragged an item out of
- Fixed the green equipped border staying on a trinket after you unequip it
- Fixed a renamed macro keeping its old name
- Scrolling the main bar skips bars already on screen again
- **Paging**: *Smart* only differs from *Default* on druids, and now says so

### Unit frames

- Fixed an invisible frame eating clicks around the target, target-of-target,
  pet and focus frames after opening edit mode
- Fixed party frame settings only applying when someone joined or left the group
- Fixed party members vanishing when combat started
- XP bar text is centred again when rested XP is showing

### Edit mode

- The *Empty* placeholder keeps the frame's shape — no more oversized box over a
  narrow bar

### Elsewhere

- Fixed guild and community list avatars not loading
- Fixed the blank gap where an out-of-range player's name goes in tooltips
- Aimed Shot shows a cast bar

### For bug reports

- `/df log blockers` — what is taking mouse input at a spot
- `/df log tot` — why the target-of-target frame is hidden
- Keybinding under **DragonflightUI → Debug** captures whatever is under the
  cursor, with a window to copy it out of
- Repeated log lines are counted, not repeated

## 0.41.1 — Revived (26 July 2026)

### Undo and redo in edit mode (new)

- Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on a Mac) undoes, Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z redoes, while the edit
  mode panel is open
- Covers everything you change there — dragging a frame, a slider, a dropdown —
  and a small note on screen names what it just put back
- History lasts for as long as edit mode is open

### Bars that stand on their own (new)

- New **Stand On Its Own** checkbox at the top of each bar's Position settings.
  On, it moves alone; off, it goes back to moving with the frames it was
  attached to
- Neither switch moves anything on screen — things stay exactly where they are,
  they just stop travelling together
- By default the main action bar is stuck to the reputation bar, which is stuck
  to the XP bar, so dragging the XP bar dragged all three. Tick it on the XP bar
  and it moves alone

### Movable windows (new)

- The character pane, trade window, inspect, quest log, spellbook and talent
  window can be dragged by their title bar, and stay where you put them
- Settings → Misc → **Movable Windows**, with a Reset button that hands every
  window back to the game's own placement
- Windows you never move are left exactly where the game puts them. A window
  only stops taking part in the game's window arranging once you have moved it
  — which is also what lets it stay open alongside the others, so the character
  pane and trade window can finally sit side by side

### Errors and combat blocks

- Fixed the "Invalid frame handle" error thrown every time you entered combat.
  It also meant frames that were meant to fade in combat silently never did
- Fixed the error when casting certain spells
- Fixed the error when using a consumable in combat
- Fixed "action blocked" spam when hovering or clicking your action bars mid-fight
- Fixed the stutter caused by `#showtooltip [@mouseover]` macros. An earlier
  attempt at this broke casting and was pulled; it is back now without that
  side effect

### Action bars vanishing

- Fixed every bar disappearing after anchoring the XP bar to an action bar.
  Anchoring one to the other closed a loop, and the error took the rest of the
  setup with it
- An anchor choice that would form a loop is now refused politely: the frame
  anchors to the screen and says so once, instead of erroring on every settings
  change
- **MoP:** fixed having no action bars at all, while the options still showed
  them as on
- **MoP:** fixed an error on every drag in edit mode
- **MoP:** fixed the focus target frame being resized unexpectedly, and the
  warning it logged on every layout update

### Action bars

- Action buttons stuck greyed out until you moused over them
- Bars 6–8 unresponsive on TBC and refusing dragged spells
- Micro menu and bag bar: hide, transparency and mouseover settings now
  actually apply
- The bag bar's expand arrow does something

### Party frames

- Class colour and gradient options work on the new party frames
- Health bars no longer stuck washed-out, and no longer dimmed by Blizzard
  over the top of our styling
- Correct power bar art
- Frame art sits behind the bars instead of over them
- Names truncate before the role icon and stay on one line
- Debuff row moved off the power bar
- Status text sized to fit the bar
- Party frames have their own settings page, edit mode entry and move handle
- Our styling can no longer break Blizzard's own party frame update loop

### Loot rolls

- Rebuilt on retail's actual loot roll frame
- Retail need/greed/pass icons instead of the classic dice and coin
- Preview button and real customization options in settings
- The preview shows a full drop, with working tooltips over it
- Adjustable gap between stacked rolls
- Fixed the restyle aborting partway, which was also taking the whole UI
  module down with it

### Edit mode

- Fixed the unit frames being shoved around when you open Blizzard's own Edit
  Mode. They stayed wrong until you next left combat
- Fixed frames disappearing when you left edit mode and only returning after
  a reload
- Fixed frames resetting to the wrong position after login or a loading screen
- Leaving edit mode only hides frames that exist purely to be dragged
- Frames with nothing to show get a labelled placeholder you can grab
- Only one edit mode open at a time — opening Blizzard's closes ours, and the
  other way round
- Closing edit mode during combat no longer makes it reopen by itself when the
  fight ends

### Nameplates

- Nameplate style is a real setting, and applies live without a reload
- Fixed a second level number appearing on styles that already have one
- Fixed level placement so it matches each style

### Chat

- The chat window can be selected and moved in DFUI's edit mode
- Chat no longer stretched or shunted around by Blizzard's edit mode
- Fixed tabs past the first rendering shifted upward when chat sits at the
  bottom of the screen
- An undocked tab can no longer be dragged off the screen and lost
- The combat log's filter bar no longer covers your other chat tabs

### Character pane

- The Dragonflight paperdoll artwork shows only on the Character tab, instead
  of bleeding onto Reputation, Skills and Pet
- The border around the model area is treated as paperdoll art too, so it no
  longer floats behind the skill list

### Reloading in combat

- One clear message instead of several, and everything the fight blocked is
  re-applied once combat ends
- An on-screen panel explains why the UI looks half-built, rather than a chat
  line that is easy to miss mid-pull

### Settings and reporting

- Bug reports show a real version number instead of `@project-version@`
- Turned-off features are marked "(off)" and can be switched back on from
  their own page, instead of being dead greyed-out entries
- The quest tracker can be disabled without disabling the whole Minimap module
- The settings window can be dragged by its header
- New `/df log` debug log, which records errors and blocked actions to disk so
  bug reports can include a real log

## 0.41.0 — Classic Era 1.15.9 support (22–25 July 2026)

The 1.15.9 patch replaced the Classic Era interface with a backport of the
modern one — Blizzard Edit Mode, retail-style action bars, pooled party
frames — which broke most of the addon. This update is the overhaul for it,
and also adds support for TBC 2.5.6 and MoP 5.5.4.

### Loading and stability

- The addon no longer half-loads and gives up partway through login
- The interface no longer visibly builds itself piece by piece for a second
  after you log in
- Reloading mid-fight finishes the job the moment combat ends, instead of
  leaving the UI half native
- Fixed the quest tracker freezing the game
- Fixed a wave of errors from interface pieces the patch removed

### Action bars

- Page arrows on the main bar work again, cycle all 6 pages, and keep working
  in combat
- The page number next to them updates again
- Shift-scrolling to change pages no longer strobes between two pages
- Keybinds on bars 6–8 fired nothing
- Bars 6–8 showed every spell twice
- Bar backgrounds were missing entirely
- Empty slots show while you are dragging a spell, and a vacated slot updates
  immediately
- Added the retail main bar frame, with an adjustable darkness setting for the
  fill behind the buttons
- Pet bar restored to its proper size, with correct highlight, active and
  autocast art
- The taxi and vehicle exit button uses the retail round arrow and sits at the
  end of the main bar instead of floating mid-screen
- Micro menu and bag bar line up with each other properly
- Fixed the garbled guild button and the stray green square in the micro menu

### Raid and hover performance

- Fixed the big one: frame skips and stutter when moving the mouse across raid
  frames
- Buff timers no longer churn the garbage collector every frame
- The character stats panel no longer listens to events for every unit in the
  world
- Keeps Questie's raid safeguards working when the client cuts its startup
  short, a major source of raid frame drops

### Nameplates (new)

- New Nameplates module: Dragonflight-styled enemy plates, outlined names and
  class-coloured enemy players

### Party and unit frames

- Full Dragonflight restyle for the new pooled party frames, including
  portraits, role icons and frame art
- Pet buffs and pet happiness restored
- Fixed the target frame's reaction-coloured bar hanging around
- Unit frame positions survive Blizzard's layout applications

### Character pane

- Retail Dragonflight pane background, and the plates framing your gear
  columns
- Restored the slot frame art and the border around the model
- Weapon row centred properly, with the ammo slot and arrow placed correctly
  for classes that use one

### Loot rolls

- Rebuilt on the real Dragonflight loot roll, replacing the classic-looking
  one
- Live tally of what everyone has picked while the roll is running
- Winner announced when it resolves

### Buffs

- Buff and debuff timers keep their real remaining time across a reload,
  instead of restarting at full
- Fixed doubled buffs

### Minimap and misc

- Minimap sits in the corner at a sane default size
- XP bar tooltip works again
